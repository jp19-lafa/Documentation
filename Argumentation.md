FarmLab is an automated hydroponics farm that utilizes an array of sensor to make smart decisions and create the optimal growing environment.

Multiple nodes can work together to create a big farm network. You can manage all your nodes on the [Farmlab] [webplatform].

## Hydrophonics? What is this?
The cultivation of these plants follow the 'hydroponics' technique. This means the plants are planted directly in water without any type of soil. They are fed by nutrients added to that water. This is a better environement for the plants because of the controlled situation.

## What do plants need ?

All plants need sunlight, nutrition, water, clear air, time to grow and optional healthy soil. With Farmlab we try to manage all of the factors needed to grow healthy plants. In the farm we'll control the humidity and  the temperature of the environement of the plants and of the reservoir where the plants are placed in. For example some plants like it more cold by night and a little warmer during the day. 

Plants get there energy from sunlight en nutrition. Plants planted in soil, they take up nutrients and water through there roots. This process to get nutrition through the roots take up a lot of energy from the plant. If there is for example not enough nutrients in the soil and the plant can't get enough sunlight during the day the plant can't grow according the [photosynthesis], gets weak and leggy looking.

Farmlab controlles the whole farm and ensures that they can grow in optimal conditions. The plants get the right amount of nutrition, light, etc during day and night. They will also grow better and faster than plants planted in soil. Because they don't need to use as much energy to get there needs from the water they just need to absorb it.

Every plant type grows differently and all the plants won't be fully grown at the same time. That's why the farm mixes camera's and technology to know when that type of plant is ready to be harvasted.

## Mobile app

With the mobile app you can setup your farms quick and easily. If there is a problem or the plants are ready to be harvasted you will get a notification from the app and then it's time to see what you have grown.

## The Farmlab

The lab is build out of smart sensors, pumps, electronics and this all works togheter because of the main controller. The controller request data from all the connected devices. The requested data will be processed and evaluated so we keep this optimal environement for the plants. On the [webplatform] u can monitor and adjust all the data of the selected farm.

## It still takes time
One thing that you can't forget. The plants may grow in almost optimal conditions this does not mean that they grow instant. To grow plants this will take some time. The effort to grow is up to the farmlab.
