## Ledstrip verlichting

### Specifications
* Led style: SMD 5050
* Color: red, blue
* IP rating: IP65
* Beam angle: 180°
* Voltage: 12V DC

Plants use light mostly for photosynthesis. The plant absorbs spectrums of light and there is a peak in the blue and red region wich means that these colors are used for photosynthesis. More about [color] [spectrum]?

Because of how plants grow we use a red and blue blue ledstrip. It depends on your goals, if you add

`Red Light (630 -660 nm)` is essential for the growth of stems, as well as the expansion of leaves. This wavelength also regulates flowering, dormancy periods, and seed germination.

`Blue Light (400 -520 nm)` needs to be carefully mixed with light in other spectra since overexposure to light in this wavelength may stunt the growth of certain plant species. Light in the blue range also affects the chlorophyll content present in the plant as well as leaf thickness.

`Green Light (500 – 600 nm)` penetrates through thick top canopies to support the leaves in the lower canopy.

`Far Red Light (720 – 740 nm)` also passes through dense upper canopies to support the growth of leaves located lower on the plants. In addition, exposure to IR light reduces the time a plant needs to flower. Another benefit of far red light is that plants exposed to this wavelength tend to produce larger leaves than those not exposed to light in this spectrum. ([link])

## Peristaltic pump

### Specifications
* Flowrate: 2-100ml/min
* Voltage: 12V DC
* Current: 400mA

Peristaltic pumps are used to pump fluids without exposing those fluids to the pump components. The specifications are good to be implemented into Farmblab for water and nutrition.

## Stepper motor Nema17

### Specifications

* Motor type: bipolar stepper
* Holding torque: 60Ncm
* Rated Current/phase: 640mA
* Phase resistance: 15ohms
* Inductance: 32mH ± 20%(1KHz)
* Voltage: 10V

This stepper motor will be used in the XY-system to move the camera that will monitor the plants stages of growth.
